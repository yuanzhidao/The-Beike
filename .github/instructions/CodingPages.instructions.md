## Coding Guidelines for Pages

When creating or modifying Flutter UI pages in the `lib/pages/` directory, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Unified App Bar Design**: Generally, each page should use our custom app bar defined in `lib/utils/app_bar.dart`.
2. **Dynamic Theming**: It's recommended to use `Theme.of(context)` to obtain colors and text styles.
